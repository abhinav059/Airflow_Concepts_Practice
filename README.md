🚀 Exploring Airflow TaskFlow API and XCom for Seamless Data Sharing Between Tasks 🚀

As I continue my journey with Apache Airflow, I’ve recently been working with the TaskFlow API and XCom to improve how tasks communicate and share data within a DAG.

🔄 TaskFlow API: Airflow's TaskFlow API simplifies task creation by allowing Python functions to be used directly as tasks. This makes DAGs more readable and easier to manage, especially when passing data between tasks.

🔗 XCom (short for "cross-communication"): XCom allows data to be shared between tasks, making it essential for dynamic workflows. With XCom, I can pass data between different tasks in a DAG without relying on external storage systems, ensuring efficiency and clean task orchestration.

🛠️ Here's what I've implemented recently:

Leveraging the TaskFlow API to streamline the task creation process.
Using XCom to seamlessly exchange data between tasks, reducing external dependencies.
This combination has allowed me to build more modular and maintainable DAGs, improving overall workflow efficiency.

If you're working with Airflow or planning to, I highly recommend exploring these features!
